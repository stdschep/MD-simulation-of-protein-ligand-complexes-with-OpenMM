# Molecular Dynamics simulations

This repo is the result of effords to facilitate simulations of proteins and protein/ligand complexes using OpenMM. Additionally, the contenys are optimized to run on the Flemish high performace computing infractstructure (VSC-HPC) at the UGent.
This repo includes:
1. A script to simulate proteins *
2. A script to simulate protein/ligand complexes **
3. A script to align and renumber the output **
4. A GUI interface to facilitate parameter input

\* Code based on output from OpenMM-setup (https://github.com/openmm/openmm-setup.git)

** Code based on scripts from @tdudgeon's 'simple simulate complex' repo (https://github.com/tdudgeon/simple-simulate-complex.git)
